Implmenting the follow task with respect to the Extend Api.

What I think There is TODO Next:
- Refactor all the Contexts with a base Context Class
- Handle Default Values for all the config strings better (ASP.NET has better solutions for this)
- Add Refresh Logic for the Auth - ASP.NET lets you actually register async services for this.
- Actually Formally Decided How we want to handle Exceptions:
    - More Error Handling (error codes? Exceptions etc.)
    - Proper Exception Handling
